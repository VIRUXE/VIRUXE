Hi, I'm Flávio, and I've been coding stuff since screeching 56kbps dial-up was still a thing.

Here you'll find a mix of my personal projects, open-source contributions, and past professional work that's free to share.

I'm a firm believer in both leg day and reading documentation – if I don't know it, I'll learn it.

Feel free to explore my [repositories](https://github.com/VIRUXE?tab=repositories) and [gists](https://gist.github.com/VIRUXE), and drop me an [e-mail](mailto://flavioaspereira@gmail.com) if you'd like to chat.
